Public assets (recommended for static files you want served as-is):

- Put images you want to reference via a root path here (e.g., `/assets/my-image.png`).
- Files in `public` are copied to the dev server root by Vite and served at `/`.

Examples:
- <img src="/assets/placeholder.svg" alt="example" />

Use this folder for: favicons, large static images, or assets referenced directly from `index.html`.
